requirements probably have modules im not actually using but I didnt use a virtualenv so I cant do a pip freeze and I'm too lazy to find exactly all of them so requirements.txt is my pip list replace the stuff in config.py if yours is different 

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

export FLASK_APP=app

python3 -m flask run
